# FACT: Unfairness optimiser


## Installation

This project is built as a library and can be installed with
```
pip install setup.py
```

Furthermore, we have listed our dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
You can install them by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

One of our dependencies is PuLP, which requires you to have a linear solver
installed on your machine. Refer to their documentation for more information.

On Debian-based systems you can try either of the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get install glpk-utils  # GLPK
sudo apt-get install coinor-cbc  # CoinOR
```


## Running

As this project's main goal is to reproduce the experiments of [1],
we have provided the `reproduction.ipynb` notebook, where we generate most of
the graphs from the paper.

Most of the algorithm is present in `unfairness_optimiser.py`, with the rest of
the files providing supporting functions.
