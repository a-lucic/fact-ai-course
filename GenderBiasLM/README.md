# FACT-AI 2020 course: Identifying and Reducing Gender Bias in Word-level Language Models

This repository contains the source code and results for the ["Identifying and Reducing Gender Bias in Word-level Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03035) paper.


The supporting material re-implements the approach as much as possible, however there are many details missing from the published work. There exist several discrepancies between the provided code and the implementation detailed in the original paper and the lacking information has forced a couple of intuitive experimental design choices to be made which might not match the intended method. Nonetheless, the source code is not able to reproduce the results reported by the paper above with a significant difference in the performance of the de-biasing metric introduced.

The jupyter notebook can be run to evaluate the existing algorithm and the training scripts are provided for reproducibility.
