### Data
For these experiments to run efficiently it is advised to download the pre-trained models and pre adjusted datasets.

unpack the datasets in the 'dataset' folder\
[pixel_perbutation](https://we.tl/t-vRK8oyPxoo)
[roar](https://we.tl/t-6EMIrE3Kct)
[extra-test](https://we.tl/t-9SXz30whky)

unpack the models in the saved-models folder
