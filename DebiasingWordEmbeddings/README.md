# Debias Word Embeddings

Are you using pre-trained word embeddings like word2vec, GloVe or fastText? `Debiaswe` allows you to easily remove gender bias.
No longer can nurses only be female or are males the only cowards.

This repository was made during the FACT-AI course at OurUniversity, during which papers from the FACT field are reproduced and possibly extended.

## Getting Started

Here we will outline how to access the code.

### Prerequisites

To run the code, create an Anaconda environment using:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
or create an empty environment, install pip in this environment and run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all dependencies for this package.

### Installing

To use the code from this package, simply download or clone the repository.

## Available pre-trained embeddings
Several pre-trained embeddings are provided and are automatically downloaded upon creating a `WordEmbedding` object with the name of one of the available embeddings. The embeddings are based on <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/">Word2vec</a>, <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a>, and <a href="https://fasttext.cc/">fastText</a>.

The available embeddings are listed below.

| Embedding name | dimensionality | vocabulary size | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|
| `word2vec_large`     | 300 | 3M |
| `word2vec_small`     | 300 | 26423 |
| `word2vec_small_hard_debiased`     | 300 | 26423 |
| `word2vec_small_soft_debiased`     | 300 | 26423 |
| `glove_large`     | 300 | 1.9M |
| `glove_small`     | 300 | 42982 |
| `glove_small_hard_debiased`     | 300 | 42982 |
| `glove_small_soft_debiased`     | 300 | 42982 |
| `fasttext_large`     | 300 | 999994 |
| `fasttext_small`     | 300 | 27014 |
| `fasttext_small_hard_debiased`     | 300 | 27014 |
| `fasttext_small_soft_debiased`     | 300 | 27014 |

Note that because of the large computational workload, hard debiasing of large embeddings (entire vocabulary) is very difficult and soft debiasing with the current setup is impossible, and are therefore not available for download.

### Embedding from file
Besides the available embeddings, it is also possible to load embeddings from a file on your device. If the embedding is very large and loading the embedding takes unreasonably long, make sure the filename ends with "large" (possibly preceding a file extension). E.g. `./myfolder/myembedding_large.txt`. This makes sure that the embedding is loaded using the `gensim` package, which scales better with large embeddings. However, if you do this, the first line of the file **must** contain the number of words in the embedding, followed by a space, followed by the embedding dimensionality, e.g. for `glove_large` this is `1900000 300`.

Besides this first line for large embeddings, each line in the file must start with a word from the vocabulary, followed by the vector values, separated by whitespace characters. Binary (.bin) files are also supported for the available word2vec binary embedding files, but support is not guaranteed for manually created binary files and should not be heavily relied upon.

#### Example
```
from debiaswe.we import WordEmbedding

w2v = WordEmbedding('word2vec_small')

my_embed = WordEmbedding('./myfolder/myembedding.txt')
```

## Running the experiments

A general tutorial on the usage of this package, together with some of the experiments are available in the Jupyter notebook in the repository.\
For a full replication of all the available experiments, you can execute the `experiments.py` script.\
Use
```
python experiments.py -h
```
in your terminal to get a list of options on which experiments to run.

NOTE: Creating analogies is a very costly procedure which requires comparisons between a lot of different words. For larger word embeddings, this quickly results in memory issues. Even for `glove_small`, which contains 42982 words, creating analogies may prove problematic. To run the benchmarks without generating analogies, use the `--no_show` flag to avoid creating analogies and profession analysis:
```
python experiments.py --no_show
```
